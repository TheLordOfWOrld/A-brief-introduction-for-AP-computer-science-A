# VARIBLES
## Hint: there have something that will not appaer in AP exam; I will mark them using **

There have a array of data type in Java 
Let's see
```
public class varible {
    int val0 = 0;
    double val = 0.0;
    float val2 = 0.0f;
    boolean val3 = false;
    char val4 = 'a';
    String val5 = "Hello";
    byte val6 = 127;
    short val7 = 32767;
    long val8 = 9223372036854775807L;
}

```
Seems like it's difficult to understand these thing rightï¼Ÿ Even this code just contain some of data type of Java! 
Don't worry most of data type will not apper in AP exam

### Firstly I will tell you the basic characterristics of some data type
```int``` means integer, int type such as 114, 514, 1919, 810 etc. The upper bound of ```int``` is 2147483647, lower bound is -2147483648
**```float```which menas floating-point type, in other words it can store fractional part of a number such as 3.1415f, 2.71f, 0,13567f etc range :  -3.403E38~3.403E38
```double```which menas double floa; it have bigger voulme and more precise fractional part of a number such as 0.0, 2,3, 3,1415, 2.71828 etc range : -1.798E308~1.798E308
```char``` represent characters in the normal sense (1 character =2 bytes). All characters in Java are encoded in Unicode, so a character can store a letter like "A" "c"
```boolean```only can store true and false
```string```Is a special data type called reference type. generally, it just strore a address of data(like a pointer in c/c++) ; string data looks like "hello" "Are you happay today?"
etc

### Then I will tell some rule of operation for data type
double can store the value int, but int can't store double varible
Example:
```
int a = 0;
double b= 9.7;
a = b //IS INVAILD !!!!!!!!!
b = a //yes!!!
b-=a //yes!!!
a-=b //NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
```
Rules of String  sth like this : 1+1=11 
```
String s0 = new String("thanks for your watching!!!");
String s1 = "aaa";
String s2 = "bbb";
String s3 = s1+s2   // equals aaabbb
```

## reference type
We can use ```new``` keyword to create a reference type
reference type store a address for actuall value of varible 
somesting like this:
```
int a = new Integer(90);
double b = new Double(8.7);
```
